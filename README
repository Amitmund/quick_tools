### For owner ###
Steps: if you want to add or edit things at this repo. [ example: adding Updating README file ]
a. vi README [ update your content.]
b. git add README
c. git commit -m â€œUpdating README file"
d. git remote add origin https://github.com/Amitmund/quick_tools
e. git push -u origin master

# It will ask your username and password please provide the same.


# Few more Note:

$HOME/.gitconfig is your global config for git.
There are three levels of config files.

 cat $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.git/config
(mentioned by bereal) is your local config, local to the repo you have cloned.

you can also type from within your repo:

git remote -v
And see if there is any remote named 'origin' listed in it.

If not, if that remote (which is created by default when cloning a repo) is missing, you can add it again:

git remote add origin url/to/your/fork
