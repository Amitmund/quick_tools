In my screenrc, I have changed:
change ctrl-a to ctrl-x

Also, I have to provide "configuration" file instead of .screenrc and the filename I am using as screenrc

#so to start my screen session:
screen -S amundScreen -c screenrc
# in the above command, I am giving a name "amundScreen" to this session along with the screen configuration file.
# so, if you detach, and do "screen -ls", you will see the name some thing like: "<pid>.amundScreen"

Few inside screen commands:
c = ctrl
c-x c: create new tab in side my screen.
c-x <number>: to move to that screen tab.
c-x <shift>-a: rename the current screen tab  

### Quick screen command options ###
-c file       Read configuration file instead of '.screenrc'.
-d (-r)       Detach the elsewhere running screen (and reattach here).
-r            Reattach to a detached screen process.
-R            Reattach if possible, otherwise start a new session.
-S sockname   Name this session <pid>.sockname instead of <pid>.<tty>.<host>.
-x            Attach to a not detached screen. (Multi display mode).
